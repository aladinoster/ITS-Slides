    \begin{exampleblock}{General characteristics}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Intersection are equipped with several on--off detectors
    \item Every intersection is controlled by a single--intersection controller
    \item A fusion of data from GPS and magnetic detectors is used in order to say to the controller how far the trams are
    \item Several constant parameters (min/max green time, amber time) are decided as function of the speed limit, the number and size of lanes, the size of the intersections
    \end{itemize}
