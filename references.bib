abstract = {Low-speed merging maneuvers performed within a free-flow stream are believed to trigger congestion. These accelerating moving bottlenecks introduce local constraints that can disturb the flow at a local or global scale. Low-speed merging maneuvers are also suspected to cause capacity drop. Using the kinematic wave theory, this paper explores the analytical solution of a simple first-order model when moving boundary conditions are introduced. The paper shows that shock waves initiated by low-speed merging maneuvers are a linear transformation of the moving boundary conditions, no matter the shape of the moving boundary condition. These results are then applied to typical situations to show that the interaction of two moving boundaries can modify the analytical solution of the problem. The results are then extended to multiple merging maneuvers to show that they can interact. Every possible interaction between two identical merging maneuvers is explored to identify the conditions that lead to global congestion. Finally, these results are used to propose an analytical formulation of the capacity drop for multiple merging maneuvers at a single location. It is shown that capacity drop is related to the demands on the minor and major streams and to the speed of the merging vehicle.},

abstract = {Recognition of necessities of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is gaining momentum. CAVs can improve both transportation network efficiency and safety through control algorithms that can harmonically use all existing information to coordinate the vehicles. This paper addresses the problem of optimally coordinating CAVs at merging roadways to achieve smooth traffic flow without stop-and-go driving. We present an optimization framework and an analytical closed-form solution that allows online coordination of vehicles at merging zones. The effectiveness of the efficiency of the proposed solution is validated through a simulation, and it is shown that coordination of vehicles can significantly reduce both fuel consumption and travel time.},

@article{Ntousakis2016:TR-C,
abstract = {One of the main triggers of traffic congestion on highways is vehicle merging at on-ramps. The development of automated procedures for cooperative vehicle merging is aimed to ensure safety and alleviate congestion problems. In this work, a longitudinal trajectory planning methodology is presented, developed to assist the merging of vehicles on highways; it achieves safe and traffic-efficient merging, while minimizing the engine effort and passenger discomfort through the minimization of acceleration and its first and second derivatives during the merging maneuver. The problem is formulated as a finite-horizon optimal control problem and is solved analytically. This enables the solution to be stored on-board, saving computational time and rendering the methodology suitable for practical applications. The tunable weights, used for taking into account the different optimization criteria, may serve as parameters to match the individual driver's preferences. The proposed methodology is first developed for a pair of cooperating vehicles, a merging one and its putative leader. Moreover, an alternative solution procedure via a time-variant Linear-Quadratic Regulator approach is also presented. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is utilized to compensate possible disturbances in the trajectories of the cooperating vehicles, whereby the analytical optimal solution is applied repeatedly in real time, using updated measurements, until the merging procedure is actually finalized. Subsequently, the methodology is generalized for a set of vehicles inside the merging area. Various numerical simulations illustrate the validity and applicability of the method.},

abstract = {A novel strategy to enhance string stability of autonomous vehicles with sensor delay and actuator lag is proposed based on a model predictive control framework . To com - pensate sensor delay , the approach entails estimating the (unknown) system state at the current time using the system state in a previous time , the applied control history and a system dynamics model . The actuator lag is compensated by including the lag in the state prediction model . The mathematical framework shows that without the antic - ipation strategy , sensor delay leads to a worse estimate of the initial condition for the optimal control problem and actuator lag increases the mismatch between the system state prediction model and the actual system behaviour . Simulation verified that sensor delay and actuator lag degrade string stability of platoons . The proposed anticipatory control strategy shows clear benefits in improving autonomous vehicle string stability and hence has potential to enhance traffic flow stability .},

More precisely, we consider a single conservation law, deduced from conservation of the number of cars, defined on a road network that is a collection of roads with junctions. The evolution problem is underdetermined at junctions, hence we choose to have some fixed rules for the distribution of traffic plus an optimization criteria for the flux. We prove existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions to the Cauchy problem. Our method is based on wave front tracking approach, (B), and works also for boundary data and time dependent coefficients of traffic distribution at junctions, so including traffic lights.},

Different concepts of solution are discussed, including Pareto optima, Nash and Stackelberg equi- libria, and the co-co (cooperative-competitive) solutions. Section 3 introduces the basic framework of differential games for two players. Open-loop solutions, where the controls implemented by the players depend only on time, are considered in Section 4. It is shown that Nash and Stackelberg solutions can be computed by solving a two-point boundary value problem for a system of ODEs, derived from the Pontryagin maximum principle.},

@article{Wang2015:TR-C,
abstract = {This contribution puts forward a receding horizon control approach for automated driving systems, where tactical-level lane change decisions and control-level accelerations are jointly evaluated under a central mathematical framework. The key idea is that controlled vehicles predictively determine discrete desired lane sequences and continuous accelerations to minimise a cost function reflecting undesirable future situations. The interactions between controlled vehicles and surrounding vehicles are captured in the cost function. The approach is flexible in terms of application to controller design for both non-cooperative control systems where controlled vehicles only optimise their own cost and cooperative control systems where controlled vehicles coordinate their decisions to optimise the collective cost. To determine the controller behaviour, the problem is formulated as a differential game where controlled vehicles make decisions based on the expected behaviour of other vehicles. The control decisions are updated at regular frequency, using the newest information regarding the state of controlled vehicles and surrounding vehicles available. A problem decomposition technique is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the original problem by introducing a finite number of sub-problems and an iterative algorithm based on Pontryagin's Principle is used to solve sub-problems efficiently. The proposed controller performance is demonstrated via numerical examples. The results show that the proposed approach can produce efficient lane-changing manoeuvres while obeying safety and comfort requirements. Particularly, the approach generates optimal lane change decisions in the predicted future, including strategic overtaking, cooperative merging and selecting a safe gap.},
