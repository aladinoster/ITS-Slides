\begin{frame}{Final comments}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item We have designed an optimization--based algorithm to control green split of traffic lights
    \item The control algorithm is applicable to large cities thanks to its scalability property
    \item Numerical simulations show the improvements w.r.t. standard fixed--time policies
    \item The algorithm can be adapted to real scenarios and in simulations it performs better than "real world" traffic lights scheduling algorithms
    \end{itemize}
