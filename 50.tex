    Set up:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Traffic lights plan virtually replicated into Aimsun
    \item Input flow and supply estimated by real data extracted by loop detectors\dots
    \item \dots as well as split ratios at intersections\dots
    \item \dots from 7am to 10am
    \item Adaptation of the OSA-TC to fit this scenario's technological requirements
    \item A posteriori analysis of on--line measured data (within Aimsun)
    \end{itemize}
