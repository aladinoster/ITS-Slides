\begin{frame}{Context on vehicle platooning}
\metroset{block=fill}
    Truck platooning has some ideas in mind: 
      \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item \textbf{Objective}: Improve fuel consumption in trucks 
        \item \textbf{Traffic issues}: 
        \begin{itemize}
          \item String stability \(\rightarrow\) flow stability.
          \item Interactions at network discontinuities \(\rightarrow\) Capacity drop. 
        \end{itemize}  
      \end{itemize}
      \onslide<4->{There however still some concerns regarding interaction between them and the reality}
      \begin{block}<5->{Objective}
        The main objective today is to propose a strategies for \structure{promoting  Connected \& Automated Vehicles maneuvers} at network discontinuities.
