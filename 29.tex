    \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> The intrinsic complexity of the most descriptive traffic models (microscopic) makes them unsuitable for control synthesis
    \item<2-> We rely on macroscopic representations, starting off with the CTM and extending it to account for signalized intersections (S-CTM)
    \item<3-> The binary dynamics of traffic lights can be approximated with an average trajectory (Avg-CTM) that proves in practice to be a good approximation of the former
    \item<4-> The Avg-CTM is a smoother model, suitable for control design with duty cycle as control variables
